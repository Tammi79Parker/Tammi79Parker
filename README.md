## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior backend developer currently focused on learning and building with Node.js and SQL. This space serves as a reflection of my learning journey as I deepen my understanding of backend development fundamentals, from server-side logic to database management.

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring the core concepts of Node.jsâ€”how to build simple servers, work with Express, handle routing, and manage middleware. Iâ€™m also learning how to structure backend projects in a clean and maintainable way, while gradually incorporating best practices around RESTful API design and error handling.

On the database side, Iâ€™m getting hands-on with SQLâ€”learning how to design schemas, write queries, manage relationships, and interact with databases from a Node.js environment. Understanding how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated is a key part of what Iâ€™m focusing on, and I enjoy experimenting with both raw SQL and query builders like Knex.js.

This repository is a place where I share my practice projects, small experiments, and anything else I build as I continue learning. These projects might not be perfect, but each one helps me improve and gain more confidence as a backend developer. Whether itâ€™s a simple CRUD API or a basic authentication flow, everything here is part of the learning process.

If youâ€™re also learning backend development or want to offer feedback, Iâ€™d love to connect! Feel free to check out the code, open issues, or leave suggestions. Every bit of insight helps, and Iâ€™m always open to improving and growing with the support of the developer community.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to learning one line of code at a time!
